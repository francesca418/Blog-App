Our app uses a RESTful API implemented with Express, since it is a common framework and its CRUD operations meet the needs of the project. It also uses the following:
1. MongoDB for data storage
2. jsonwebtoken for authorization
3. bcrypt for password encryption
4. Socket.IO for realtime notifications / client-server communication
5. Jest, Supertest, and Selenium for testing
6. Travis CI for continuous integration
7. Heroku for deployment
