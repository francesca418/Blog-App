## Figma Wireframes & Prototypes

We created wireframes and prototypes using Figma. They can be viewed at this link:
https://www.figma.com/file/gYWRCQIHk9khj7aoqdwoWN/My-Blog?node-id=0%3A1 

In addition, we have provided some wireframes / prototypes in this page of the wiki for your perusal below. The most detailed wireframing and prototyping of the application is contained at the link above (though those are older and may differ slightly from the current iteration of the application). The entire application functionality has been prototyped at that link.
